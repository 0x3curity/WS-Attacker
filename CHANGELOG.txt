Framework Changes:
    - The code design was a bit out-dated since 2009. Thus, it is heavily
      refactored. Most important change: Almost every component like
      AbstractPlugin or AbstractOption are now using the Java bean concept.
      This was needed to improve the UI.
    - New Plugin Configuration Screen, new UI Components for Options
    - New Request/Response GUI
        - Support for additional/custom HTTP Headers
        - Shows response HTTP Headers
        - URL Endpoint is now changeable
    - Simplyfied maven structure
    - Added custom checkstyle rules
    - Bumped SoapUI to version 4.6.4
    - Framework now saves last used WSDL URI
